				<h4>Introduction</h4>
				In this writeup we are gonna take a look at a challenge that is about a so called <a href="https://encyclopedia.kaspersky.com/glossary/use-after-free/">use-after-free vulnerability</a>.
				Before we get started I just want to note that this challenge got solved during a stream of <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/sup3rhero1">sup3rhero1</a>. You can find the VOD<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/769484557">here</a>.
				Unfortunately I was not able to fully comprehend the solution in the context of the stream, so I had to do some research afterwards myself.	This writeup you are reaind is the result of that research.
