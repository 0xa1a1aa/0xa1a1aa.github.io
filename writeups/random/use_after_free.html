				<h3>Introduction</h3>
				<p>In this writeup we are gonna take a look at a challenge that is about a so called <a href="https://encyclopedia.kaspersky.com/glossary/use-after-free/">use-after-free vulnerability</a>.
				Before we get started I just wanted to note that I saw this challenge solved during a stream of <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/sup3rhero1">sup3rhero1</a>. You can find the VOD <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/769484557">here</a>.
				Since I wasnt able to fully comprehend the solution in the context of the stream, I had to do some research myself afterwards. This writeup you are reading is the result of that research.</p>

				<h3>Resources</h3>
				<p>You can find the challenge <a href="https://github.com/ctf-wiki/ctf-challenges/tree/master/pwn/heap/use_after_free/hitcon-training-hacknote">here</a>.</p>
				<p>The file <b>exp.py</b> is a fully working exploit, i.e. its a solution of the challenge. We will develop an almost identical solution in the Exploitation section.</p>

				<h3>Testing & Research</h3>
				<p>Ok so if we take a look at the repository we can see 3 files that are part of the challenge:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>flag</li>
					<li>hacknote</li>
					<li>hacknote.c</li>
				</ol>
				<p>The file <em>flag</em> just contains the flag that we should get by exploiting the <em>hacknote</em> executable. Fortunately we are also given the source code of the executable in the <em>hacknote.c</em> file.</p>
				<p>Ok, so before we start to look at the C source file lets first execute the <em>hacknote</em> program in order to see what the executable does.</p>
				<img class="cmdline" src="./images/menu.png" />
				<p>After launching the program we are greeted by a small menu. We can either add, remove or print a note or just exit the program. So lets try to create a note and print it.</p>
				<img class="cmdline" src="./images/print_oob.png" />
				<p>In the attempt to printing the first note by giving an index of 1 we got an error. Lets try it again with the index 0.</p>
				<img class="cmdline" src="./images/print_ok.png" />
				<p>So far so good, we created a note and printed its content. But what happens if we create a note, delete it and then try to print it?</p>
