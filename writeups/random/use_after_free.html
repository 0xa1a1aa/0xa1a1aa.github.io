				<h4>Introduction</h4>
				<p>In this writeup we are gonna take a look at a challenge that is about a so called <a href="https://encyclopedia.kaspersky.com/glossary/use-after-free/">use-after-free vulnerability</a>.
				Before we get started I just wanted to note that I saw this challenge solved during a stream of <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/sup3rhero1">sup3rhero1</a>. You can find the VOD <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/769484557">here</a>.
				Since I wasnt able to fully comprehend the solution in the context of the stream, I had to do some research myself afterwards. This writeup you are reading is the result of that research.</p>
